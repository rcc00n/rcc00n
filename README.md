## About

I design and build **production-grade backend systems** for startups and digital products.  
My focus is on **architecture, scalability, and business-critical logic** rather than demos or prototypes.

I work best on:
- backend-heavy products
- marketplaces & SaaS platforms
- systems with payments, bookings, and admin workflows
- ideas that are meant to ship and scale
